# AWS CloudTrail Client Package #

**aws.cloudtrail** is a simple client package for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) [CloudTrail](http://aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/) REST API, which can be used to monitor use of AWS web services API calls by logging API requests in an S3 bucket.

## Installation ##

[![CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/aws.cloudtrail)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=aws.cloudtrail)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudyr/aws.cloudtrail.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudyr/aws.cloudtrail) [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/cloudyr/aws.cloudtrail/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/cloudyr/aws.cloudtrail?branch=master)

To install the latest development version from GitHub, run the following:

```R
if(!require("devtools")){
    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
}
install_github("cloudyr/aws.cloudtrail")
```

To install the latest version from CRAN, simply use `install.packages("aws.cloudtrail")`.

To use the package, you will need an AWS account and enter your credentials into R. Your keypair can be generated on the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential) under the heading *Access Keys*. Note that you only have access to your secret key once. After it is generated, you need to save it in a secure location. New keypairs can be generated at any time if yours has been lost, stolen, or forgotten. 

By default, all **cloudyr** packages look for the access key ID and secret access key in environment variables. You can also use this to specify a default region. For example:

```R
Sys.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "mykey",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "mysecretkey",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1")
```

These can alternatively be set on the command line or via an `Renviron.site` or `.Renviron` file ([see here for instructions](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html)).



## Code Examples ##

A CloudTrail is a log of API calls made to AWS. The service is incredibly easy to use. It simply requires creating a trail that defines where (i.e., in what AWS S3 bucket) the CloudTrail log should be stored.

To use CloudTrail, start by creating an S3 bucket. This can be done using the **aws.s3** package:

```{r}
library("aws.cloudtrail")
library("aws.s3")
putbucket("MyExampleBucket")
```

```{r}
trail <- create_trail(name = "NewTrail", bucket = "MyExampleBucket")
get_trails() # see trail in list of trails
```

Note: The s3 bucket should exist (perhaps created using **aws.s3**) and have write permissions granted to CloudTrail. An example permission document is provided by `cloudtrail_s3policy()`.

Once a trail is created, it can be updated (e.g., to move it to a different bucket, to activate event notifications using SNS, etc.) using `update_trail()`.

```{r}
# move trail to another bucket
putbucket("MyOtherExampleBucket")
update_trail(name = "NewTrail", bucket = "MyOtherExampleBucket")

# send SNS notifications when log updated
update_trail(name = "NewTrail", sns_topic = "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:My-Topic")

# log global calls (e.g., IAM)
update_trail(name = "NewTrail", global = TRUE)
```

Once created and configured, it is easy to start logging requests using `start_logging()` and stop logging using `stop_logging()`:

```{r}
start_logging(trail$Name)
trail_status(trail$Name)$IsLogging # check logging status
stop_logging(trail$Name)
```

If you're done with a trail, you can delete it and it will no longer show up in your trail list:

```{r}
delete_trail(trail$Name)
get_trails()
```
