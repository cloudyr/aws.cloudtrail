# AWS CloudTrail Client Package #

**aws.cloudtrail** is a simple client package for the Amazon Web Services [AWS CloudTrail](http://aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/) REST API, which can be used to monitor use of AWS web services API calls.

## Installation ##

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/aws.cloudtrail.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leeper/aws.cloudtrail)

To install the latest development version from GitHub, run the following:

```R
if(!require("devtools")){
    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
}
install_github("cloudyr/aws.cloudtrail")
```

To install the latest version from CRAN, simply use `install.packages("aws.cloudtrail")`.
```

## Code Examples ##

A CloudTrail is a log of API calls made to AWS. The service is incredibly easy to use. It simply requires creating a trail that defines where (i.e., in what AWS S3 bucket) the CloudTrail log should be stored:

```R
trail <- create_trail(name = "NewTrail", bucket = "MyBucket")
```

Once a trail is created, it can be updated (e.g., to move it to a different bucket, to activate event notifications using SNS, etc.) using `update_trail`.

ADD UPDATE EXAMPLE HERE

It is easy to start logging requests using `start_logging` and stop logging using `stop_logging`:

```R
start_logging(trail$Name)
trail_status(trail$Name)$IsLogging # check logging status
stop_logging(trail$Name)
```

If you're done with a trail, you can delete it and it will no longer show up in your trail list:

```R
delete_trail(trail$Name)
get_trails()
```
